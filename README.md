# signal.h_ctrlc
Write a function that computes factorial of received integer. 
The function can return 0 if the integer is negative. Use the function in a program that receives integer input repeatedly from the user. The program can be terminated only by pressing CTRL+C. We have to include <signal.h> header file into the c program.
